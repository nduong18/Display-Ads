# Display Ads - Success Page Clone
URL PAGE: https://nduong18.github.io/Display-Ads/

This folder contains a small static page that reproduces the screenshot you provided (a blue header with "Success!" and explanatory paragraph, plus a small floating widget on the right).

Files:

- `index.html` — the page
- `styles.css` — styling to match the screenshot

Preview locally:

1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run a simple HTTP server (Python is the easiest option):

```powershell
cd 'C:\Visual Studio Code\WorkSpace\Displayads'
python -m http.server 8000
```

3. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Notes and next steps:

- The floating widget is decorative SVG; if you want it interactive (clickable to open a link), I can wire that up.
- If you'd like pixel-perfect fonts/spacing, tell me the exact font and sizes and I can adjust further or export assets.
